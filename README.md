<p>
    Developed a program to analyze historical Bitcoin price data and forecast price trends for the next 30 days. The program utilizes a machine learning approach by employing a Random Forest Regression model from the scikit-learn library. Historical data was split into training and testing sets using the test-train-split function to evaluate the model's performance and avoid overfitting.
